    <p>Hi, my name is Jeff Carlow. I come from a career in finance and investments for
      the past 10 years. I originally grew up in Connecticut, and attended Bentley University
      in Waltham, MA. I have spent some time living in Southern California prior to coming to Denver.
      I am looking forward to a new and exciting career as a full stack Developer.
   </p>
    <p> When I am not coding I enjoy hanging out with my australian shepherd, Rudy. Rudy and I both enjoy running as well.
      It keeps me in shape, and Rudy nice and calm! I also enjoy brewing and drinking craft beer, and attending concerts during the summmer.
      I also try and visit Charleston as often as possible, as it is my favorite place in the world, it is also in the same
      state as Clemson. Go Tigers! Thank you for visiting my page!
   </p>
